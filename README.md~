# Angular-Meteor Boilerplate


## Usage

Since Meteor v1.4.4.2 you can use this example to create a working Angular app based on this boilerplate:
```
git clone https://github.com/samsalfer/angularMeteorTemplate.git
```

## NPM Scripts

This boilerplate comes with predefined NPM scripts, defined in `package.json`:

```
meteor npm install
```

## Boilerplate Contents

This boilerplate contains the basics that requires to quick start with Angular-Meteor application.

This package contains:

- TypeScript support (with `@types`) and Angular 2 compilers for Meteor
- Angular2-Meteor
- Angular 2 (core, common, compiler, platform, router, forms)
- SASS, LESS, CSS support (Also support styles encapsulation for Angular 2)
- Testing framework with Mocha and Chai
- [Meteor-RxJS](http://angular-meteor.com/meteor-rxjs/) support and usage

This application also contains demo code:

- Main Component (`/client/index.html`)
- Demo Child Component (`/client/templates/test.html`)

The Main component loads the child component.

### Folder Structure

The folder structure is a mix between [Angular 2 recommendation](https://johnpapa.net/angular-2-styles/) and [Meteor 1.3 recommendation](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html).
